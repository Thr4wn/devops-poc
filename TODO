[ ] deploy app to /srv

[ ] deploy app
    [ ] how to deploy? sparse checkout | checkout submodule ?
    [ ] make salt state to deploy by grain.
    [ ] use piller to define things?

[ ] use docker to snapshot changes to prod

[ ] create new AWS for preprod. Then docker pull updates from prod

[ ] packer provision new preprod/prod machines.

[ ] on every push to master branch on app repo, automatically deploy.
    [ ] perhaps Huggin?
    [ ] this means that I need a script to deploy. migrate and pull.
